```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(car)
library(corrplot)

df=read.table("concrete.txt", header=TRUE)

fit=lm(CompressiveStrength~Cement+Slag+FlyAsh+Water+SP+CoarseAggr+FineAggr,df)

summary(fit)

vif(fit)

```
a) This shows severe multicollinearity because most VIFs are greater than 10.

b) In a data analysis, severe multicollinearity can cause instability in the parameter estimates, their standard errors, and p-values.

```{r}
cc<-cor(df)
corrplot(cc)

fit1=lm(CompressiveStrength~Cement+Slag+FlyAsh+Water+SP+FineAggr,df)

vif(fit1)

```

c) The correlation between water and coarse aggregates is the highest. So, I suggest excluding coarse aggregates variable then we can avoid problems with multicollinearity because The VIFs are all less than 5.
